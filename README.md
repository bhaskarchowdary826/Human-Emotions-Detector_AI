# Human Emotion Detection System üé≠

A real-time human emotion detection system that classifies facial expressions into one of seven emotions: **Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised**. Built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and a **pretrained CNN model**.

---

## Features ‚ú®
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects emotions in real-time using a webcam.
- **Seven Emotions**: Classifies facial expressions into seven emotions.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves **~65% accuracy** on the FER-2013 dataset.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple and intuitive interface for easy interaction.

---

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and video processing.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training the CNN model.
- **Haar Cascade**: For face detection.
- **FER-2013 Dataset**: Contains 35,887 grayscale images of facial expressions.

##Dataset üìÇ
FER-2013: A dataset containing 35,887 grayscale images (48x48 pixels) of facial expressions.

Emotion Classes: Angry, Disgusted, Fearful, Happy, Neutral, Sad, Surprised.

Data Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling were used to improve model generalization.

---

##Training Process üß†
Data Preprocessing: Images were resized, normalized, and augmented.

CNN Model: Built with multiple convolutional layers.

Training: Trained for 50 epochs using categorical cross-entropy loss.

Evaluation: Achieved ~65% accuracy on the validation set.


---

##Pretrained Model ü§ñ
Why Pretrained Models?:

Save time by avoiding training from scratch.

Leverage learned features for faster deployment.

Provide robust performance in real-world conditions.

Model Used: model.h5 (pretrained CNN model).


---


##Workflow üìä
Capture: Use OpenCV to capture frames from the webcam.

Face Detection: Detect faces using Haar Cascade.

Preprocessing: Crop, resize, and normalize the face.

Emotion Prediction: Feed the processed image into the pretrained model.

Output Display: Display the detected emotion.
